        <h2 id="hobby">Reading books</h2>
        <p id="text">I love reading books because it is a good and knowledgeable timepass and it is fun to read. I have read many of the books which my parents have got for me. I have read some Geronimo Stilton Books and I have completed reading the Harry Potter series. I like to read books because they give you knowledge, increase your vocabulary and it is a good source of entertainment. Once I was reading my Science textbook as soon as I woke up!</p>
